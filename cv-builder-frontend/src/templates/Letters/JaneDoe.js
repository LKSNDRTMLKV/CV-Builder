        description: "Thank you for agreeing to answer my questions earlier this week regarding your website advertisement for the Customer Service position currently available at Acorn Merchandising.My qualifications and experience complement the responsibilities outlined in your advertisement and include over 10 years of customer service experience in increasingly challenging roles. I have been able to advance in my career through demonstrated initiative and the ability to work effectively under pressure. In my most recent position, as Customer Support Representative at a large pharmaceutical manufacturing company, I was given the opportunity to overhaul our entire department. My modifications increased our efficiency by 57%. I have developed the ability to work independently in a complex environment, which has strengthened my communication and organizational skills. My training includes a secretarial diploma and courses in Organization and Resource Management. As you can see by my resume, I have an ongoing commitment to professional development. I would be available to start this position with 2 weeks' notice. I look forward to hearing from you to further discuss this opportunity. I can be reached at the numbers indicated below; a message can be left on my machine if I am not available. Thank you for your consideration.",
